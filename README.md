In this article we explore one of the most popular domain of Machine Learning which is based on artificial neural networks known as Deep Learning. Mainly we focus on how Deep learning can be applied for detecting cancer at early stages. Two types of datasets has been considered on Breast cancer and Prostate cancer among which the Prostate cancer is available as the image dataset given in the DICIOM format which actually draws interest as handling medical images in this format in recent days is one of the most important task in the field of medicines. An Artificial Neural Network(ANN) has been applied to the Breast Cancer data for prediction purpose. The study also gives an idea of what are the steps to be followed to read this DICOM image format in a programming language like python and then do the necessaries.
